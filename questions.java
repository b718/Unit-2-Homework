    //Question 1: What output is printed to the terminal when singOldMacdonald is invoked?

    //Cow Moo space Dog Woof

    //Question 2: How would you invoke the verse method if you wanted to sing about a duck that
    //quacks?

    // System.out.println(" ");
    // verse("Duck", "Quack);

    //Question 3: What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are
    //spaces and where there are newlines.

    //public static void zoop() {
    //baffle();
    //System.out.print("You wugga ");
    //baffle();
    //}
    //public static void main(String[] args) {
    //System.out.print("No, I ");
    //zoop();
    //System.out.print("I ");
    //baffle();
    //}

    //public static void baffle() {
    //System.out.print("wug");
    //ping();
    //}

    //public static void ping() {
    //System.out.println(".");
    //}

    //No, I wug.
    //You wugga wug.
    //I wug.

    //Question 4: Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is
    //invoked.
    // This entire thing stops when ping is called
    
    //Question 5: What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? 
    //It infintely stacks ontop of each other until overflow error.
